The data was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+). Categorical variables were changed to numerical ones in order to facilitate analysis.\n",

    "You'll use sequential forward selection, sequential backward floating selection, and recursive feature elimination. After implementing each wrapper method, you'll evaluate the model accuracy on the resulting smaller feature subsets and compare that with the model accuracy using all available features."
